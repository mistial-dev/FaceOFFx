```

## Code Style Guidelines

### General Principles

- Use C# 12.0 features where appropriate
- Enable nullable reference types
- Follow functional programming patterns (Result\<T>, Maybe\<T>)
- No nulls in domain models - use Maybe\<T> for optional values
- Direct dependencies - use libraries directly without wrapper abstractions

### Formatting

- Use the .editorconfig settings provided
- Run `dotnet format` before committing
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Keep methods focused and small

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all public methods
- Use AwesomeAssertions for test assertions
- Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR

### Comments and Documentation

- Add XML documentation comments to all public APIs
- Keep comments concise and meaningful
- Update README.md if adding new features

## Pull Request Process

1. **Before submitting:**
   - Ensure all tests pass: `dotnet test`
   - Run code formatting: `dotnet format`
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Add/update tests for new functionality

2. **PR Guidelines:**
   - Create a descriptive title
   - Reference any related issues
   - Describe what changes you made and why
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - Keep PRs focused - one feature/fix per PR

3. **Review Process:**
   - PRs require at least one approval
   - Address review feedback promptly
   - Keep discussions professional and constructive

## Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:

- Clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- System information (OS, .NET version)
- Sample code or images if applicable
- Error messages or stack traces

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please:

## Architecture Guidelines

### Domain-Driven Design

- Keep domain models in Core project
- No external dependencies in Core (except CSharpFunctionalExtensions)
- Use value objects for domain concepts
- Keep business logic in domain models

### Clean Architecture

- Dependencies flow inward (Infrastructure → Core)
- Use interfaces for external dependencies
- Keep frameworks at the edges
- Separate concerns clearly

### Error Handling

- Use Result\<T> for operations that can fail
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Fail fast with descriptive errors
- Log errors appropriately
