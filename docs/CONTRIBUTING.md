## Code Style Guidelines

### General Principles

- Use C# 12.0 features where appropriate
- Enable nullable reference types
- Follow functional programming patterns (Result\<T>, Maybe\<T>)
- No nulls in domain models - use Maybe\<T> for optional values
- Direct dependencies - use libraries directly without wrapper abstractions

### Formatting

- Run `dotnet format` before committing
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Keep methods focused and small

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all public methods
- Use AwesomeAssertions for test assertions
- Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR

### Comments and Documentation

- Add XML documentation comments to all public APIs
- Keep comments concise and meaningful
- Update README.md if adding new features

## Pull Request Process

1. **Before submitting:**
   - Ensure all tests pass: `dotnet test`
   - Run code formatting: `dotnet format`

   - Add/update tests for new functionality

2. **PR Guidelines:**
   - Create a descriptive title
   - Reference any related issues
   - Describe what changes you made and why
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - Keep PRs focused - one feature/fix per PR

3. **Review Process:**
   - PRs require at least one approval
   - Address review feedback promptly
   - Keep discussions professional and constructive

## Reporting Issues
